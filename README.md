## Food Spoiling

###### Spoiled for choice!

A simple mod that checks for food items in the player's inventory or backpack, ticks them there, and increases the spoilage over time until they are considered rotten. Foul play!

### TODO:

* Merge partially spoiled food stacks
* Handle other inventories like backpacks
* Disable re-equip animation when holding spoiling food
* Render food increasingly rotten
